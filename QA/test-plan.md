# Test Plan – Coffee Recommender System ☕

## 1. Introduction
This document describes the test plan for the *Coffee Recommender System*, an academic web application that recommends coffee types using a rule-based system implemented in Prolog and integrated into a modern web application.

The purpose of this document is to define the testing scope, strategy, environment, and deliverables to ensure the correct behavior of the system.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Validate the correct operation of the Prolog-based recommendation engine.
- Verify the interaction between frontend, backend, and Prolog logic.
- Ensure that user inputs through the chatbox generate expected recommendations.
- Detect functional defects during development.

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope
- Functional testing of the coffee recommendation logic in Prolog.
- Validation of user inputs through the chatbox.
- Communication between frontend (React) and backend (Node.js / Express).
- API responses generated by the Prolog engine.
- Basic user interaction flow.

### 3.2 Out of Scope
- Performance and load testing.
- Security testing.
- Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
- Accessibility testing.

---

## 4. Test Strategy
The following testing approaches will be used:
- **Manual testing** based on predefined test cases.
- **Black-box testing**, focusing on system inputs and outputs.
- **Integration testing** between frontend, backend, and Prolog.
- **Regression testing** after logic or rule changes in Prolog.

---

## 5. Test Types
- Functional Testing
- Integration Testing
- Smoke Testing
- Basic User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

---

## 6. Test Environment
- Operating System: Windows
- Frontend:
  - React
  - Vite
  - Tailwind CSS
- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- Logic Engine:
  - Prolog
  - Prolog–JavaScript integration via Engine.js
- Tools:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Git / GitHub
  - Web Browser (Chrome)

---

## 7. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan (`test-plan.md`)
- Test Cases (`test-cases.md`)
- Test Report (`test-report.md`)
- Bug Report (`bug-report.md`)

---

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 8.1 Entry Criteria
- Prolog rules are defined.
- Backend API is available.
- Frontend chatbox is functional.
- Test cases are documented.

### 8.2 Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed.
- Critical and major defects resolved.
- Test report completed and reviewed.

---

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities
- Tester:
  - Execute test cases.
  - Report defects.
- Developer:
  - Fix reported issues.
  - Update logic rules if required.
- Reviewer:
  - Review test results and documentation.

---

## 10. Risks and Mitigation
|          Risk          | Impact |           Mitigation           |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Incorrect Prolog rules | High   | Validate logic with test cases |
| Integration issues     | Medium | Test API endpoints separately  |
| Incomplete user inputs | Medium | Add input validation tests     |

---

## 11. Approval
This test plan is approved once reviewed and accepted before test execution.
